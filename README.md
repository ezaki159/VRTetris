## Game Rules

- A block dropper, drops random tetrominos throughout in a random place of the vast play field.
- The user must walk himself or teleport in the play field to reach the tetrominos and grab them with his own two hands. 
- Two tetrominos can be held at each time, with both hands respectively.
- There are 8 different types of tetronimos, including special 3D ones.
- The block dropper may occasionaly drop rare power ups, such as a tetromino remover drop.
- The player must place the tetrominos in a 5x5x5 play table.
- The player must complete a horizontal layer of tetrominos to gain points, and such layer will be removed from the game.
- If the player does not catch a fallen tetromino in 5 seconds, it will be destroyed and the player loses one out of his initial 3 lives.
- If a player throws a tetromino out of the play field, he loses 5 points.
- The game ends when the player reaches 0 lives.
- The objective of the game is to get as much points possible before the end of the game.
- As time progresses the level of dificulty will increase, where as levels increases, the block dropper will spawn new tetrominos faster and at harder to reach location.
